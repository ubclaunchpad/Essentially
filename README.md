## About Essentially

A tool to spend your time reading what's actually important. Essentially is a Chrome extension that analyzes and ssummarizes articles on the web. Additionally, you can use `Lens` to delve deeper into what you want to know more

## Getting Started

We plan to publissh Eentially on the Chrome Webtroe by March 2023; but, fret not, you can download and setup esentially on your laptop or desktop and use it.
there are 3 main steps to get Essentially up an running and should take no more than a few minutes

#### Setup

- you need to first setup the extension locally on Chrome
  - Refer to the readme located in the `frontend` folder on how to setup and run the extension
- To connect the extension to servers you should run the extension API and ML servers simultaneously
