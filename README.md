## About Essentially

A tool to spend your time reading what's actually important. Essentially is a Chrome extension that analyzes and summarizes articles on the web. Additionally, you can use `Lens` to delve deeper into what you want to know more

## Getting Started

We plan to publish Esentially on the Chrome Webstore by **April 2023**; but, fret not, you can download and setup Esentially on your laptop or desktop and use it.
there are 3 main steps to get Essentially up and running and should take no more than a few minutes

#### Setup

- you need to first setup the extension locally on Chrome
  - Refer to the readme located in the `frontend` folder on how to setup and run the extension
- To connect the extension to the server you should run the extension API and ML servers simultaneously
  - Refer to the readme located in the `backend` folder on how to run the server
  - Refer to the readme located in the `summary_be` folder on how to run the server

## Roadmap

we anticipate to have 3 major phases before Essentially is _essentially_ done (pardon the pun).
so far Phase 1 is completed and Phase 2 has started.

#### Phase 1:

- [x] Extension setup and design
- [x] basic text extraction
- [x] basic text summarization and keyword finder
- [x] text hover and lookup

#### Phase 2: **_(Main gist)_**

- [ ] Summary 2.0
- [ ] Lens 2.0
- [ ] UX/UI enhancements

#### Phase 3

TBD
